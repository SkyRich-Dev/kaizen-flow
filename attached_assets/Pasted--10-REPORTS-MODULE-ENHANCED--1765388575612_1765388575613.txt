====================================
10. REPORTS MODULE (ENHANCED)
====================================

Extend the Reporting Module with deeper analytics, multiple report types, configurable parameters, and downloadable archives. Preserve all existing reporting requirements and add the following enhancements:

10.1 REPORT TYPES (NEW)
Implement a Reports Center with the following report categories:

1. Workflow Performance Reports
   - TAT (Turnaround Time) per stage:
     - Initiation → CFT
     - CFT → HOD
     - HOD → AGM
     - AGM → GM
   - Bottleneck identification (e.g., which department has the highest pending load).
   - Average approval time by role.

2. Kaizen Effectiveness Reports
   - Cost savings achieved vs. proposed.
   - Productivity impact scoring (aggregated from risk assessments).
   - Department-wise Kaizen contribution count/impact.

3. Compliance Reports
   - Rejection reasons grouped by:
     - CFT department
     - HOD
     - AGM/GM
   - Missing documentation alerts (requests with missing PFMEA, CRR, checklist).
   - Audit trail completeness verification.

4. Resource & Cost Allocation Reports
   - Total cost of approved Kaizens by month, quarter, year.
   - High-cost Kaizen list (>100k) with justification summary.
   - Manpower/Process addition trend report.

   - User can create a custom report by selecting:
     - Fields (status, cost, department, dates, risk factors, approval time, etc.)
     - Filters
     - Sort options
     - Export format (CSV, XLS)

10.2 REPORT UI/UX
Create a dedicated **Reports Dashboard** with:

- Left-hand panel:  
  Workflow Performance | Kaizen Effectiveness | Compliance | Cost Allocation | Custom Builder

- Right panel:  
  Selected report view  
  - Filters (date range, department, status, cost band, role, etc.)
  - Data table with pagination  
  - Chart visualizations:
    - Bar chart
    - Line graph
    - Donut/pie charts
    - KPI cards  

- Export buttons:
  - Export current table to CSV/XLS
  - Export full report package as ZIP (CSV + charts as PNG)

10.3 ADVANCED FEATURES
- Scheduled Reports  
  Add ability to configure scheduled reports (weekly/monthly) that auto-generate and store in a “Report Archive”.

- Report Archive  
  A storage area listing past generated reports with:
  - Report name
  - Type
  - Generated date
  - Download link

====================================
11. SETTINGS MODULE (NEW)
====================================

Create a full administrative **Settings Module** accessible only to Admin/Management roles. It must include the following categories:

11.1 USER & ROLE MANAGEMENT
- Create/Edit/Delete users

  - HOD
  - AGM
  - GM
  - Admin
- Activate/Deactivate users
- Reset password/reset credentials

11.2 DEPARTMENT MANAGEMENT
- Add/Edit/Delete departments
- Set department attributes (name, head of department, default approver)

11.3 APPROVAL CONFIGURATION (DYNAMIC SETTINGS)
Enable dynamic management of:
- Cost thresholds:
  - ≤50k (HOD)
  - 50k–100k (AGM)
  - >100k (GM)
- Change the values anytime; workflow should reference these dynamic values (not hard-coded).
- Enable/Disable mandatory AGM approval for manpower/process additions.
- Configure required documents for initiation (PFMEA, CRR, Checksheet).

11.4 WORKFLOW SETTINGS
- Turn ON/OFF CFT involvement for specific departments.
- Set escalations (e.g., auto-escalate to HOD if CFT does not act within X hours).
- SLA (Service Level Agreement) settings for each stage:
  - CFT review SLA
  - HOD review SLA
  - AGM/GM review SLA
- SLA breach notifications settings.

11.5 NOTIFICATIONS SETTINGS
- Email template editor (text-based)
- Notification triggers toggle:
  - On submission
  - On escalation
  - On approval
  - On rejection
- Add CC/BCC rules for departments.

11.6 MASTER DATA MANAGEMENT
- Programs master list
- Customer Part Number master list
- Station master list
- Risk factor scoring configuration
- Document category definitions

11.7 SECURITY SETTINGS
- Password strength rules
- Multi-factor authentication toggle (optional)
- Session timeout settings
- Attempt lockout threshold

11.8 AUDIT LOG VIEWER (ADMIN ONLY)
- Searchable log of all system actions
- Filters:
  - User
  - Module
  - Action type
  - Date
- Export audit logs

====================================
12. SETTINGS UI/UX REQUIREMENTS
====================================

- Left-side navigation:
  Users | Departments | Workflow | Approvals | Notifications | Master Data | Security | Audit Logs
- All settings screens must:
  - Display form fields clearly
  - Validate input
  - Confirm updates with modal popup
  - Provide change history (version log for settings)

====================================
13. DATA MODEL EXTENSIONS
====================================

Add new tables/collections for:

- settings_cost_thresholds
- settings_workflow
- settings_notifications
- settings_master_data
- scheduled_reports
- report_archive
- audit_logs (extend existing one)
- sla_configurations

====================================
14. IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES
====================================

- All new modules must integrate seamlessly with existing roles and workflow logic.
- Do NOT modify the core approval flow or rejection rules.
- Settings changes should take effect immediately in the workflow.
- Reports must respect role-based visibility:
  - Initiators → only reports related to their submissions
  - CFT → only departmental analytics
  - HOD → department-wide insights
  - AGM/GM → cost/performance reports
  - Admin → full access

Finish by generating:
- Updated backend endpoints
- Updated frontend UI components
- Sample data for settings and reports
- Routing updates for new modules
